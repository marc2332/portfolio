# Openbank's broken expenses summary

> March 8 2025
<br/>
Hey! here we are again talking about Openbank... 
\
Check out my other [blog post](/posts/openbank_useless_2fa_movements_history) to learn about Openbank useless 2FA for movements history.
\
**Openbank** has a monthly expenses summary and ... its kinda broken.
\
Let's suppose you are going to pay `X` amount of money to `5` different people using normal transfers.
\
That basically means `X * 5`, so for example, if `X` is `10€` then it would be `10€ * 5 = 50€`.
\
One would expect that if Openbank would include those `50€` in the monthly summary, but, it doesn't! Instead it shows `10€`!
\
This is because if you send the same amount of money, no matter to who, and in a row, openbank will effectively compact these transactions as if they would have only been one.
\
Here we have the actual transactions list:

<br/>
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
    <Image width={850} height={400} src="/openbank_expenses.png" alt="Openbank transactions list" align="middle" />
</div>
<br/>

And here we have the expenses summary, notice how we went from 4 1€ to just 1 1€. 

<br/>
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">

</div>
\
This is an backend bug by the way, its not in the UI.
\
That's basically it, just another day finding out bugs in a bank.
