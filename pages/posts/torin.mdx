### Introduction
I'll be sharing with you an overview of **Torin**, a **UI Layout library** I have been developing for my GUI library [**Freya**](https://github.com/marc2332/freya).
\
When I started working on Freya I quickly went on to adding new layout features, this lead to the layout logic being too coupled with other core logic of Freya, this eventually got to a point where it was blocking the addition of new features such as incremental torin.
\
So, one day a thought came to my mind, the idea of doing a library from-scratch that followed Freya's existing layout system but was entirely decoupled from the project.
\
That thought eventually became **Torin**.

### What does it exactly do?
**Torin** measures both the **size** and **position** of UI elements and caches these values for later use. 
\
Consumers using Torin provide the layout configuration of each Node through a abstraction in the form of a trait, called `DOMAdapter`. This will allow Torin to read the DOM without you having to make a copy of it.
\
It is important to note that Torin only measures **areas**, other type of elements such as text is not intended to be supported. These though, can still be integrated by hooking into the measurement system through the use of a custom measure function, in there, third-party libraries such as **Skia** or **cosmic-text** can be used freely.
\
To understand more or less the flow that goes when using Torin, here there is some pseudocode:
```rust
// 1. Create a Nodes Tree (DOM) of the UI
let freya_dom = FreyaDOM::new();
let root_id = Node(0);
freya_dom.add(root_id, NodeData {
    width: Size::Pixels(100.0),
    height: Size::Pixels(100.0)
})

// 2. Create the Torin tree
let mut torin = Torin::new();

// This could be the size of the window
let canvas_size = Size2D::new(1000.0, 1000.0);
// 3. Measure the layout of the Nodes tree
torin.measure(&mut freya_dom, canvas_size);

// 4. Read the computed layout of the root node
let root_node = torin.get(root_id);
assert_eq!(root_node.size.width, 100.);
```

### How to use Torin

Now that you have a general idea of what the flow is, let's use the actual API.
But first we need to create our own DOM from where Torin will read the Nodes layout configurations.

#### Simple DOM
This is a very simple and non-optimal implementation of a DOM that let us **Add**, **Update**, and **Remove** Nodes from the tree.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct DOMNode {
    parent: Option<usize>,  // Parent ID (Optional because Root does not have any parent)
    children: Vec<usize>,   // IDs of children
    height: u16,            // Height in the DOM (amount of ancestors between this node and the Root)
    node: Node,             // Layout node configuration
}

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct DemoDOM {
    nodes: HashMap<usize, DOMNode>,
}

impl DemoDOM {
    /// Add a Node
    pub fn add(&mut self, node_id: usize, parent: Option<usize>, children: Vec<usize>, node: Node) {
        // Get the parent's height in the DOM, default to 0 (Root) if missing
        let parent_height = parent
            .map(|p| self.nodes.get(&p).unwrap().height)
            .unwrap_or(0);


        // Assign the node a height just below its parent
        let height = parent_height + 1;

        self.nodes.insert(
            node_id,
            DOMNode {
                parent,
                children,
                height,
                node,
            },
        );
    }

    /// Update a Node
    pub fn set_node(&mut self, node_id: usize, node: Node) {
        self.nodes.get_mut(&node_id).unwrap().node = node;
    }

    // Remove a Node
    pub fn remove(&mut self, node_id: usize) {
        // Remove this Node
        let node = self.nodes.remove(&node_id).unwrap();

        // Remove this Node from the parent
        if let Some(DOMNode { children, .. }) = node.parent.and_then(|p| self.nodes.get_mut(&p)) {
            children.retain(|c| *c != node_id);
        }

        // Remove children recursively
        for child in node.children {
            self.remove(child);
        }
    }
}
```

#### DOM Adapter

Now let's implement the `DOMAdapter` trait over the `DemoDOM` struct we just made, this way Torin can later access our nodes.

```rust
impl DOMAdapter<usize> for DemoDOM {
    // Get the children Nodes of the given Node
    fn children_of(&mut self, node_id: &usize) -> Vec<usize> {
        self.nodes
            .get(node_id)
            .map(|c| c.children.clone())
            .unwrap_or_default()
    }

    // Get the parent Node of the given Node
    fn parent_of(&self, node_id: &usize) -> Option<usize> {
        self.nodes.get(node_id).and_then(|c| c.parent)
    }

    // Get height in the DOM of the given Node
    fn height(&self, node_id: &usize) -> Option<u16> {
        self.nodes.get(node_id).map(|c| c.height)
    }

    // Get the Layout configuration of the given Node
    fn get_node(&self, node_id: &usize) -> Option<Node> {
        self.nodes.get(node_id).map(|c| c.node.clone())
    }

    fn is_node_valid(&mut self, _node_id: &usize) -> bool {
        // We assume all the nodes in this DOM are actually available for measurement
        // This could not be the case in certain implementations of DOMs, like in Freya
        // where Placeholders elements not to be measured
        true

    }

    fn root_id(&self) -> usize {
        // We assume 0 is the root ID of the DOM
        0 
    }
}
```

#### Set up the DOM
Now that we have the data structures ready, let's instantiate our DOM with some hardcoded Nodes.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center py-16">
 <img src="/dynamic-root-size.png" alt="Torin" align="middle" />
</div>

```rust
let mut demo_dom = DemoDOM::default();

// Node ID 0 (Root)
demo_dom.add(
    0,          // ID
    None,       // Parent ID, because it is the root, it doesn't have any
    vec![1, 2], // Children IDs of the Nodes below
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(300.0)),
        Size::Inner,
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);

// Node ID 1
demo_dom.add(
    1,          // ID
    Some(0),    // Parent ID (root)
    vec![],     // No children
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(100.0)),
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(150.0)),
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);

// Node ID 2
demo_dom.add(
    2,          // ID
    Some(0),    // Parent ID (root)
    vec![],     // No children
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(100.0)),
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(150.0)),
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);
```


#### Initial measurement
Let's run an initial measurement of our Nodes and read their values.
```rust
// `usize` is our Node ID type
let mut torin = Torin::<usize>::new();

// Run the measurement
torin.measure(
    0,             // Suggested Root ID
    Rect::new(     // Suggested Root area
        Point2D::new(0.0, 0.0),
        Size2D::new(1000.0, 1000.0)
    ),
    &mut None,     // Custom measurer is optional
    &mut demo_dom, // Our DOM!
);

let root_node = torin.get(0)?;    // 300px x 300px
let first_node = torin.get(1)?;   // 100px x 150px
let second_node = torin.get(2)?;  // 100px x 150px
```

<div class="flex justify-center items-center py-16 flex-col">
    <p className='text-neutral-100 mb-4'>This is how the Nodes layouts would look:</p>
    <img src="/dynamic-root-size-result.png" alt="Torin" align="middle" />
</div>

#### Incremental measurement
The idea behind incremental measurement is to attempt measuring as little nodes as possible to speed up the process.
\
Let's now mutate and invalidate a Node:

```rust
// Update the node in the DOM with the new layout config
demo_dom.set_node(
    2,
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(100.0)),
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(400.0)), // Changed from 150px to 400px
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);

// Here we mark the node as dirty so that Torin knows it was changed
torin.invalidate(2);
```
\
Now, we need to call `find_best_root` before measuring the nodes layouts again.
It will attempt to find the most suitable node from which to start measuring the tree.
This means that if we happened to have a very deep tree, and the only node we changed was very deep down,
Torin wouldn't start measuring from the Root Node, but most probably 
from the Node we changed or at least an ancestor close to it.
This speeds up a lot the measuring as it skips traversing and remeasuring all those Nodes that haven't changed
since the last measurement.
\
`find_best_root` will also mark as dirty those nodes that even though were not 
changed in the DOM directly, they might have been affected by those who actually were.
This is specially common when using layout strategies to like percentages, auto, flex, etc,
where the computed layout is not solely defined by the Node itself, but by other Nodes.

```rust
torin.find_best_root(&mut demo_dom);
```
\
Now we measure the nodes for the second time:
```rust
torin.measure(
    0,
    Rect::new(
        Point2D::new(0.0, 0.0),
        Size2D::new(1000.0, 1000.0)
    ),
    &mut None,
    &mut demo_dom,
);

let root_node = torin.get(0)?;    // 300px x 550px - Changed! (was 300px x 300px before)
let first_node = torin.get(1)?;   // 100px x 150px
let second_node = torin.get(2)?;  // 100px x 400px - Changed! (was 100px x 150px before)
```

<div class="flex justify-center items-center py-16 flex-col">
    <p className='text-neutral-100 mb-4'>This is how the Nodes layouts would look now:</p>
    <img src="/dynamic-root-size-incremental-result.png" alt="Torin" align="middle" />
</div>

The most suitable Node for incremental measurement is that Node that is an ancestor to all the invalidated nodes and also those invalidated by collateral in `find_best_root`.
\
In the case of the example from above, the most suitable Node was... the **Root** (`Node 0`)! So, no incremental measures were really made!
\
This is because the Root node has a `Size::Inner` size for the **height**, which means it will have the height of its biggest children, therefore if one of these children change it needs to make sure that the Root Node also gets the new biggest height.
\
Even though its true that there was basically no incremental measurement done, we didnt really have to do anything special besides calling `Torin::invalidate()` and `Torin::find_best_root()`, which is nice.

#### Actual incremental measurement

Let's now go with an alternate DOM so we can see incremental layout at play.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center py-16">
 <img src="/fixed-root-size.png" alt="Torin" align="middle" />
</div>

```rust
let mut demo_dom = DemoDOM::default();

demo_dom.add(
    0,           // ID
    None,        // Parent ID, because it is the root, it doesn't have any
    vec![1],     // Children IDs
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(300.0)),
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(300.0)),
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);

demo_dom.add(
    1,           // ID
    Some(0),     // Parent ID (root)
    vec![2],     // Children IDs
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(100.0)),
        Size::Inner,
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);

demo_dom.add(
    2,           // ID
    Some(1),     // Parent ID (1)
    vec![],      // Children IDs
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(50.0)),
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(200.0)),
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);


// Initial measurement
torin.find_best_root(&mut demo_dom);
torin.measure(
    0,
    Rect::new(
        Point2D::new(0.0, 0.0),
        Size2D::new(1000.0, 1000.0)
    ),
    &mut None,
    &mut demo_dom,
);

let root_node = torin.get(0)?;    // 300px x 300px
let first_node = torin.get(1)?;   // 100px x 200px
let second_node = torin.get(2)?;  // 50px x 200px

// Mutate the Node 2
demo_dom.set_node(
    2,
    Node::from_size_and_direction(
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(50.0)),
        // Changed from 200px to 500px
        Size::Pixels(Length::new(500.0)),
        DirectionMode::Vertical,
    ),
);
torin.invalidate(2);

// Incremental measurement
torin.find_best_root(&mut demo_dom);
torin.measure(
    0,
    Rect::new(
        Point2D::new(0.0, 0.0),
        Size2D::new(1000.0, 1000.0)
    ),
    &mut None,
    &mut demo_dom,
);

let root_node = torin.get(0)?;    // 300px x 300px
let first_node = torin.get(1)?;   // 100px x 500px - Changed! (was 100px x 200px before)
let second_node = torin.get(2)?;  // 50 x 500px    - Changed! (was 50 x 200px before)

```

In this case the most suitable Node was not the **Root** (`Node 0`), but the `Node 1` because it is an ancestor to all the changed nodes or because it was the closest to the Root of the changed nodes. Those invalidated were `Node 2` by direct invalidation and `Node 1` because of its `Size::Inner`.
\
The Root was not affected by those changes as it has a fixed size of `300px` for both height and width.

    <p className='text-neutral-100 mb-4'>Before the changes</p>

</div>

<div class="flex justify-center items-center py-16 flex-col">
    <p className='text-neutral-100 mb-4'>After the changes</p>
    <img src="/fixed-root-size-incremental-result.png" alt="Torin" align="middle" />
</div>

### End
This was an overview over Torin, let me know if you want to know more about it, there are other features that I didn't cover like what type of layouts can be made, internal optimizations, integration with third-party text measurement libraries, etc.
